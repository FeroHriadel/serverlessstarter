# SERVERLESS STARTER

This project is a cheat sheet on how to use the Serverless Framework on AWS.
It's a REST API for frontend project - angularstarter: https://github.com/FeroHriadel/angularstarter.git

It shows how to use:
- dynamoDB
- Secondary indexes in dynamoDB
- Secondary Keys in dynamoDB
- ordering, pagination, populating data from other tables, sorting by specified criteria
- using pre-signedLink to upload files to S3

There's also a couple of things it doesn't show, though: Lambda Layers, the use of Cognito, Single Table Design, Step Functions, Mail sending... Nevertheless I believe it's a solid start
